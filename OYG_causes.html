                <p> Children who are abandoned or neglected at an early age face a variety of challenges that hinder their transition into adulthood. Many of them end up in group homes and foster care, and frequently transition between foster families in their long search to find a compatible match. In Canada, there are more than 30,000 children and youth in foster care, and in Ontario alone, there is a monthly average of almost 8,600 children and youth in care. These children urgently require financial support to ensure their well-being and prevent their situation from worsening.</p>
                <p> The transition to adulthood is particularly difficult because of the lifelong influence that neglect has had on these youth. They often suffer from health issues, mental disorders, and substance abuse, which add to the difficulties they face when becoming independent. They also lack access to basic dental care, medical care and proper clothing, as inspection reports from the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services have found.</p>

                <p>While the critical problem of inadequate support for vulnerable youth spans across the entire globe, as high schoolers it is incredibly difficult to tackle the problem in its entirety. However, we were not deterred from trying to make progress on this issue and decided to approach it from a different angle; by trying to create as much tangible change within our local community as we can, as we have far more leverage locally.</p>
